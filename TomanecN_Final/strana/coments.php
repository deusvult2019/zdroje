						<p>I decided between this and the Samsung A5 and I can say that I definitely do not regret that
							I chose Asus. Photos are in good quality. Thanks to its huge capacity, the battery lasts
								all-day use. The bad thing is that the phone sometimes overheats.
							<br>Pros: 5.5 inch display, 4100 mAh battery.
							<br>Cons: Occasionally overheating.
